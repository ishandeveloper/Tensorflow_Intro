    "In the previous example, we saw how we could create a neural network called a deep neural network to pattern match a set of images of fashion items to labels. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now, one of the things that we have have seen when we looked at the images is that there's a lot of wasted space in each image. While there are only 784 pixels, it will be interesting to see if there was a way that we could condense the image down to the important features that distinguish what makes it a shoe, or a handbag, or a shirt. That's where convolutions come in. "

    "Convolutions in a very basic way can be inferred to as applying filters on an image to enhance some of it's distinguishing features. For example a filter that helps to emphasize all the vertical lines in an image and another one for horizontal lines etc.\n",

    "#### When these convolutions are combined with something called pooling, they can become really powerful. \n",

    "## Pooling\n",
    "Simply, pooling is a way of compressing an image. A quick and easy way to do this, is to go over the image of four pixels at a time, i.e, the current pixel and its neighbors underneath and to the right of it. Of these four, pick the biggest value and keep just that. This will preserve the features that were highlighted by the convolution, while simultaneously quartering the size of the image. We have the horizontal and vertical axes."

These filters are 3 by 3, their activation is relu, which means the negative values will be thrown way, and finally the input shape is as before, the 28 by 28. That extra 1 just means that we are tallying using a single byte for color depth. As we saw before our image is our gray scale, so we just use one byte.\n",

We're saying it's a two-by-two pool, so for every four pixels, the biggest one will survive as shown earlier. We then add another convolutional layer, and another max-pooling layer so that the network can learn another set of convolutions on top of the existing one, and then again, pool to reduce the size. So, by the time the image gets to the flatten to go into the dense layers, it's already much smaller. It's being quartered, and then quartered again. So, its content has been greatly simplified, the goal being that the convolutions will filter it to the features that determine the output."
