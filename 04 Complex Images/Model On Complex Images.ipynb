    "In previous examples we built an image classifier that worked using a deep neural network and saw how to improve its performance by adding convolutions. One limitation though was that it used a dataset of very uniform images. Images of clothing that was staged and framed in 28 by 28. \n",
    "\n",
    "But what happens when we use larger images and where the feature might be in different locations? For example, how about a few images of horses and humans? They have different sizes and different aspect ratios. The subject can be in different locations. In some cases, there may even be multiple subjects. In addition to that, the earlier examples with a fashion data used a built-in dataset. All of the data was handily split into training and test sets for us and labels were available. In many scenarios, that's not going to be the case and we'll have to do it for yourself.\n",

If you multiply 35 by 35 by 64, you get 78,400, and that's the shape of the data once it comes out of the convolutions.
